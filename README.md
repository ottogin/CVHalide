Here implemented cvtColor(RGB2Y) function
Also there is some scripts, which allows you to test it
    * gray_filter_times_comparing.cpp
            allows you to compare times with the OpenCV analog
    * gray_filter_test.cpp
            allows you to check, do this function work the same as the OpenCV analog

Be careful:
    To run make, you should specify env
        export HALIDE_PATH=<path_to_your_halide>
